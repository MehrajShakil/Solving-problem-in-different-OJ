In this problem , given n string s1 , s2 , s3 ............... sn.

we can do the following operation several times.

In one operation we took a character from any string and remove the character from the string. Add this character at any string.

So that our final n string should be equal.

So, if every character's occurance should be multiple of the length.
Then it is possible to equal them.
