array length <=1e5.
array value <=1e9.

Observation 1 ::

let every value of aray = 1e9 and size of array = 1e5.
and c = 1.

then our minimum speration is.

 1e5 * ( 1e9 - 1 ).
= about 1e14.

So our minimum possible answer should less than 1e14.

Observation 2 ::

We try to find minimum possible answer using a brute force for every c while we are not find such c that minimum answer greater than 1e14.
