Observation 1 ::

If n = 1 or 2, then 'T' must win.

Observation 2 ::

sort the array increasing order.
/// 0 base index.
if ( arr[n-1] > sum of ( arr[0] .... arr[n-2] ) ) then 'T' must Win.

else {
remaining = (total sum - arr[n-1] * 2). ( half for 'T' and another fot "HL" ).
if ( remaining become odd ) then 'T' must win.
else "HL".
}

If you have any better approach , Feel free to share with me.
